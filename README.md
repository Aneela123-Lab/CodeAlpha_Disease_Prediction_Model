# CodeAlpha_Disease_Prediction_Model
Disease Prediction system using Machine Learning on medical diagnostic data, developed as part of the CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship.

This project focuses on predicting whether a tumor is **Benign** or **Malignant**
using medical diagnostic data. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning
can assist in early disease detection and support medical decision-making.

# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
